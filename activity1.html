    <p style="background-color: aliceblue;">Learning <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is <strong>important</strong> because the <ins>internet</ins> was created on and continues to rely heavily on <i>code.</i> Automated <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr>        website editors are helpful but they have their limitations. Fortunately, many automated website editors also have the ability to also use custom HTML code. So, if you want more control of your website, <i>learning how to code HTML</i> for your
        help is <br><u>key!</u>. <br></p>

    <p style="background-color: blue;">The first thing you need to know is that websites are built using a coding language called <del>C++</del> <ins>HTML</ins>. HTML is a coding language that uses tags. Tags are kind of like boxes. There are lots of kinds of boxes that have different
        <mark>"attributes"</mark> like color or size and different boxes can be used to hold different things. Some boxes are even used to hold other boxes. When using boxes to hold things in the real world, it's <strong>important</strong>to have a bottom
        and a cover for the box so it works properly and so things inside the boxes don't spill out.
        <b>HTML</b>tags are the same way.</p>
